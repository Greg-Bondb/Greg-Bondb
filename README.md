# Hi, I'm Gregory ! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a French full stack developer passionate about cybersecurity and studying in this field. Very curious about new technologies, I like to learn new things.

As a full stack developer, I am comfortable with several programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, PHP, and I have strong skills in web development, database, API development and DevOps .

My interest in cybersecurity led me to focus on understanding security best practices to protect user data, as well as studying the concepts of developing secure web applications. I am determined to learn more about cybersecurity to acquire the skills necessary to become a subject matter expert.

I am open to collaboration and learning opportunities, and I enjoy working in a team on ambitious projects. I adopt an AGILE approach to facilitate collaboration and communication between team members.
